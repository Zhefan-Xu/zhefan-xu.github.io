The UAV team is composed of 5 to 15 graduate students within the Computational Engineering & Robotics Lab (CERLAB) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). Our primary objective is leveraging our UAV technology expertise and developing algorithms to address real industrial projects. We specialize in industrial projects such as tunnel inspection, construction site mapping, and window frame inspection. Our team collaborates closely with prominent industrial partners ([YKK AP Inc.](https://www.ykkap.com/), [Obayashi Corporation](https://www.obayashi.co.jp/en/), [TOPRISE CO., LTD](https://www.toprise.jp/), etc.) to provide innovative solutions. I have led the UAV team since 2021.
